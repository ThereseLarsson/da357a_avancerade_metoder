The texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.

Different manufacturers develop their own "signature" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couvertures contain at least 70 cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50. High-quality white chocolate couvertures contain only about 35 cocoa butter.
